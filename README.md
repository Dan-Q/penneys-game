Penney's Game
=============

An implementation of Penney's Game in Javascript; an example of a non-transitive game. You can play
the game online at https://danq.me/penney/.

This is an example of a non-transitive game. The player calls three consecutive coin flips (e.g.
Heads, Tails, Tails) and then the computer does the same (e.g. Heads, Heads, Tails, in this case).
A coin is repeatedly flipped, and the winner is the player whose sequence comes up first. The
computer will generally win more often than it loses, because of the nature of the game.
